# PokerNowAnalyzer-Chatbot
This is my poker analyzer and chatbot project. To run the project, make sure you have all necessary dependencies (openai, langchain, pandas, numpy, flask, pypdf, tiktoken) installed. This can be done using pip install (package). In addition, attach your own GPT API key in constants.py. The command for running the project is python app.py once in the PokwerNowAnalyzer-Chatbot directory.
